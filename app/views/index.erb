    <h3>What are your dating profile pictures really saying about you?</h3>
    <p>
      TruthBack intends to bridge the gap between what you <i>think</i> your profile picture is saying about you and what is <i>actually</i> being conveyed to potential matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upload your photo and choose a word that describes the look you're going for.  Your photo becomes a poll for other TruthBack users- giving you instant feedback on your photos.
